    <h1 class="hea">1.Glens Bakehouse </h1>
    <h2 class="p1">A café right out of the 60s, Glen’s Bakehouse gives you a variety of modern delicacies to choose from. Present at three prominent locations in Bangalore, this is the perfect choice for brunch on a lazy weekend.

Their sandwiches are made from freshly baked bread, and Citrus Chicken, which is one of their specials and, can very well become your new comfort food.

 <h1 class="hea1">2.Dyu art cafe</h1>
 <h2 class="p2"> The perfect blend of good food and great art, Dyu Art Café is one of the most popular cafes in Bangalore amongst art lovers. An old bungalow turned into a café, it maintains the old-world charm with open courtyards and gabled roofs.
 Enjoy their choice of English breakfast and coffee brews, and spend time admiring art in the gallery. Do not miss their sinfully delicious chocolate cake and banoffee pie.

 <h1 class="hea2">3.Marzipan Cafe & Bakery </h1>
 <h2 class="p3">Founded by Greek expat, Kiki Petriti, Marzipan Café and Bakery is a beautiful and peaceful slice of Greece in the centre of busy Bangalore life. Taste some authentic Greek delicacies with freshly squeezed juices. But their desserts are their speciality, and the menu keeps changing.
Call in advance to know about the dessert of the day. From the authentic Bundt Cake to a gooey and messy Chocolate Mud Pie, if you miss their desserts then you haven’t lived

 <h1 class="hea3">4. Cinnamon </h1>
 <h2 class="p4">A one-stop destination for gourmet delicatessen items such as homemade gelato waff-wiches and freshly baked breads with an equally alluring selection of designer cakes, decorative pastries and distinctive beverages that exude innovation.

 <h1 class="hea4">5. Green Theory </h1>
 <h2 class="p5">With all-white decor, cobblestoned pathways, and flowering creepers in addition to the canopy, Green Theory will help you wind down, whether you dine outdoors or in. We're calling dibs on the outdoors though, because it's downright gorgeous, especially after a rain. Imagine dining under a canopy, reading a book, enjoying Bangalore's nippy weather while you chow on some delicious vegetarian food (with Jain options too). We recommend their pizzas.

 <h1 class="hea5">6. Third Wave Coffee </h1>
 <h2 class="p6">While the older lot has good coffee, nothing like coffee with great ambience! And the latest of the TWCs located in HSR is our top favourite. It makes you feel like you're not in Bangalore really. Although Sarjapur probably feels that way anyway! Set in a sky-lit space with loads of indoor plants, easy garden-style seating, and a massive open counter for all your coffee needs, it's a pretty space. Apart from the coffee, head here for brick-oven baked pizzas. But if it is coffee you're looking for, my favourite is the Cortado

 <h1 class="hea6">7. Hard Rock Cafe </h1>
 <h2 class="p7">Hard Rock Cafe is known for its lamb burgers and unique desserts. We also recommend their cheesy mashed potatoes (for cheat days) and overnight oats (for regular days). And how can we forget some of India’s most amazing bands that you can watch live while munching on those legendary burgers? We’re talking Aswekeepsearching and The Local Train, dude.

 <h1 class="hea7">8. Infinitea Tea Room  </h1>
 <h2 class="p8">The menu at Infinitea Tea Room has many, many teas to choose from. From your basic Darjeeling Tea and Assam Tea to some of their exotic tea-infused ice creams – Tiramisu with Muscatel Tea and Afternoon Tea with figs. This is a great place for you, if you’re a tea lover. Or you just like to try out things with names you can’t pronounce. Definitely check it out for a day out with your friends and catch up on some juicy tea, over a glass of iced tea.

 <h1 class="hea8">9. Truffles, Koramangala </h1>
 <h2 class="p9">Truffles is one of Bangalore’s most-loved food joints. The place is extremely budget-friendly and has all types of customers – students, working professionals, joint families. Their burgers, steaks and cake jars are a must-try. The servers are extremely friendly and well-mannered and the portion sizes are amazing. Especially for such affordable prices. No wonder the place is always full and you have to wait for at least 10-15 minutes to find a seat.

 <h1 class="hea9">10. The Mad Teapot Cafe </h1>
 <h2 class="p10">The Mad Teapot Cafe is an in-house cafe of the home decor store, The Wishing Chair. The whole place has a fairytale vibe to it and will remind you of those stories you used to read as a child. With potted plants and cute, pastel furniture, this cafe is, in one word, dreamy. Even their dishes have names that are equally dreamy – Forest Of Pumpkin Blossoms, Mr Grim’s Green Pasta and The Folk Of Faraway. Perfect for a first date and to start your own fairytale.
