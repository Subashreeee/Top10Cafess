    <h1 class="hea">1.Amethyst </h1>
    <h2 class="p1">A green oasis, right in the heart of the city (Whites Road),
         Amethyst has more than a serene setting to offer. An old-world colonial-style mansion,
          you can find the beautifully decked up Wild Garden Cafe here. Chessboard-style flooring, antique wooden chairs, marble-topped tables, garden and indoor seating make it a great romantic spot for some quiet time with bae.
       The menu is elaborate too with artisanal sandwiches, pizza and pasta, a daily special menu and decadent cakes, brownies, cheesecakes and more on offer. Their food portions are very generous, and their service, while attentive, is also relaxed, making it a perfect place for unwinding and indulging.

 <h1 class="hea1">2.Sage and Lavender </h1>
 <h2 class="p2">The space is designed keeping in mind a modern yet rustic aesthetic. Surrounded by green and glass, lush with natural light, Sage & Lavender aims to embody the outdoors within four walls.Sage and Lavender. You got to love the name of Chennai’s newest bistro, inspired by owner Shilpa Reddy’s favourite colours. Once inside the ‘greenhouse’ style bistro, which is something of an oasis off the bustling metropolitan TTK Road — we discover the colours are a running theme with the crockery as well. With the sunshine streaming in through the broad-panelled glass panes and leafy branches visible overhead through transparent sections of Mangalorean tiles, Shilpa tells us the idea was “to bring the outside inside”. And hands cupped around a warm brew of Vanilla Rose Latte — taking in our idyllic surroundings, we have to say — mission accomplished.

 <h1 class="hea2">3.Chamiers </h1>
 <h2 class="p3">Chamiers - One of the best cafes in chennai. This place is known for their breakfast. The ambience is so cozy and attractive. The food quality and presentation was good. You must try their cakes and coffee. We ordered Blueberry cheese cake,Hot chocolate,Latte, cold coffee,red velvet cake and mousse. The choco mousse was disaster and hot chocolate was not the best. Unfortunately theobroma cake is not available. I felt overrated as it didn’t live upto my expectation also price is bit higher. For photo lovers - totally worth ambience and for lovers - perfect dating spot!

 <h1 class="hea3">4. Fika </h1>
 <h2 class="p4">The distinctive personalities of Chennai's Fika—an amphitheatre, an orangery, a bakery, a café, and on the first floor, a community space and The Attic—all come together in an interesting interplay of indoor and outdoor, thanks to the profusion of light and greenery. There is even a set of cabanas, thoughtfully air conditioned to combat Chennai's humidity. Apart from the amphitheatre that opens in end-October, the rest of Fika was designed and completed as an adaptive reuse project in 5 months, with a soft-launch in August

 <h1 class="hea4">5. Nolitas </h1>
 <h2 class="p5">'Nolita' is short for 'North of Little Italy.' It's a beautiful eatery offering much more than just pizza. Their pizzas' speciality is that their crusts are made with hand-stretched sourdough using natural yeast, and there's a wide range of interesting toppings, making 'em all the more delectable. Words fall short of describing the aesthetics of this place. The playfulness & calmness of its blue & white theme shines through the decor. Their crockery, too, is in sync with the theme with blue and teal shades. The lush green plants & glass doors between the indoor and outdoor seating add pleasing seamlessness to the place.

 <h1 class="hea8">9. Meraki Cafe </h1>
 <h2 class="p9">A metallic walkway with wooden rafters leads to an alfresco cafe dotted with trees and shrubbery. Designed around a garden with a few large trees, Meraki Café is a 3,000 sq ft venue in Chennai that opens up gradually, one relaxed step at a time. Walls displaying vibrant and large-scale, floral murals by a local artist run through the bright space, giving patrons the impression of an exotic jungle.

What began as a renovation exercise of a bungalow in Chennai’s ECR for a cafe as an extension to the existing brand Cafe de Paris turned into an overhaul and creation of a new project that included a cafe, restaurant and coworking space. Meraki Café is the completed typology of the trio.
